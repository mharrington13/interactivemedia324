	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>My gay friend (we'll call him Pat) had a crazy experience just a few months ago. He used Grindr which is a social networking site for the gay sexy times. He had used the site successfully before and the results were always satisfactory. He started a conversation with a guy who claimed to be a 25 year old physical trainer. He sent Pat both nude pics and in pictures of himself in social situations. <br /><br />
		Pat then checked Facebook for the name he'd been given on Grinder and it checked out. The guy was actually friends with some of Pat's friends so he thought for sure he was legit. So he got his address and went to his apartment around 9 o'clock to meet up. He was instructed via chat to let himself in, walk into the bedroom and remove his clothing. So he wandered in. All the lights were off and it seemed like no-one was home but he thought it was just part of some sort of role-play. He went into the bedroom and removed his clothing as instructed. He started to get a little freaked when this mystery man quit responding too his texts. After about 15 minutes Pat decided to put his clothes back on and gtfo. <br /><br />
		As he was exiting the bedroom he turned on a few lights to gather his things. That's when a man in uniform busted through the door and told Pat to lay face down on the floor. As Pat was recounting the story I was expecting some sort of "To Catch a Predator" situation but it turns out this was the apartment security guard. He threatened to call the police but never did and Pat eventually talked the guy into letting him leave. Pat drove from there to where I and some friends were having some drinks. When he told us the story we all started doing detective work. It turns out the pictures were BS and the mutual friends on Facebook had no clue who this dude was. We all came to the conclusion that the security guard was some sort of Homophobitroll and that Pat is a fucking retard. He could have been raped or murdered but Pat never called the police out of embarrassment. <br /><br />
	Friend went to hook up got jumped by gay basher instead.
