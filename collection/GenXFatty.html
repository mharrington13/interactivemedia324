	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font> Female here. I have met four folks offa CL personals, two of which resulted in sexytime. One of them--great. Exactly what he said he'd be, cute, great time in bed, stayed for a couple hours, etc. The other--older than I expected, not good in bed, and he seriously ran out the door without his coat afterward, like the hounds of hell were after him. I do not know what was goin on but it felt nasty as hell, even as I was not thrilled with him. Perhaps his wife needed him home.<br /><br />
So...whatevs. Every once in a while when I'm longing and looking I will post a CL ad, collect a bizillion responses, and then not really want to answer any of them back cause they all seem kinda gnarly. Evidence of humanity, intelligence & responsiveness can go a long way in that context and be kind of hard to find.
