	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>Once I responded to an ad and the guy sounded GREAT. But I made the mistake of not getting a pic. I met him on a public place, gave him a look and old him I had to go. Dude looked like Whitey from Fear and Loathing. He kept trying to get me to "just go inside for one drink, one drink". I explained, through my car window, that I didn't come there to make friends and have friendly conversation. Like someone else said, if I'm meeting you FOR SEX and I find you UNATTRACTIVE, why waste my time???
