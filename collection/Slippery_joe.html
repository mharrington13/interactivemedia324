With that said:<br /><br />
1. Make sure you meet the women in a public place (bar, coffee shop, etc)<br /><br />
2. Talk to the person on the phone first<br /><br />
3. Don't plan on fucking on the first date (call me crazy, but I typically look for someone who will be fun for a couple of dates, not just a one time thing - I'm married and can afford to be picky).<br /><br />
4. Don't be surprised that the woman is lying about her occupation, age, marital status, etc. (The women I met lied about all of that and more - I think with the anonymity of CL, people tend to push the envelope).<br /><br />
5. Wear a condom!<br /><br />
I've made some long-term friends with the women I've met on Casual Encounters. But I also met a bunch that when I actually met them in person, I realized they were fucking nuts (meth addicts, women who had 15yo photos and denied it, one woman who wouldn't stop talking about how ghosts stalk her family, a woman who neglected to tell me she was 7 months pregnant, etc).
