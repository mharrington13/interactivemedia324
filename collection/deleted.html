	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>i was bored and looking for something thrilling. i made an ad, exchanged pics, talked on the phone and planned to meet. fast forward a week later, got drunk, called him over we smoked some bud and we hooked up.<br /><br />
i was ok with a one time thing, but he wanted to "hangout", which i didn't. he continued texting me to hangout, but i kept blowing him off. i came home a couple days later after thinking he took the hints and stopped texting me; to find him on my doorstepâ€¦<br /><br />
long story short-<br /><br />
he found my facebook, created fake profiles to add me, called/text constantly (had to change my #), showed up once again- when my roommate was there. i didn't think anything of it when he showed up unannounced the first time; i actually felt bad.
