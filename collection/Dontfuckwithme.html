	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font> I (female, early 20's) posted an ad on casual encounters over the summer.<br /><br />
I got hundreds--literally hundreds--of responses. I was able to narrow it down by grammar, a general feeling of chemistry, and photos. I ended up with five candidates, and made dates to meet them all.
The first guy corresponded with me for several days over emails and IMs, despite the whole "casual" part. The sexual attraction seemed to be present, so we set up a time to meet.<br /><br />
I was expecting a 25-year-old guy who kept himself up through swimming. What I got was a 40-year-old guy with a large pot belly. He was so different from his pictures that I didn't even recognize him. On the other hand, he spotted me immediately. He smiled and I saw the clincher: a mouth full of teeth sticking out at every angle. They protruded vertically from his gums, overlapped, had jagged edges. It went beyond crooked. He was a human shredder.<br /><br />
"Not what you were expecting?" he said when he finally got close enough to talk to me. The caves between his teeth were harboring god knows how much partially digested food, and his breath smelled like a corpse. "Well, I wasn't expecting you to have so many goddamn freckles, so I guess now we're both disappointed."<br /><br />
We did not sleep together.<br /><br />
I prayed that he was not going to be quite as fat as I feared, but he was. And more. I still don't know how he managed to look normal in his pictures, because he was very, very obese. Did not fuck him either.
I know that an emotional connection is not important for a casual encounter, but one of the guys I picked wanted to be short-term friends as well. He seemed smart and funny and I was lonely in a new city, so we decided to hang out before we got down to business. It turned out that I was way too sex-positive and weird for him. He actually went so far as to say, "I didn't know girls could be as strange as you. You're a freak." He was a fucking republican.<br /><br />
Although the idea of using some conservative shmuck for his cock appealed to me, it turned out that I didn't hate myself enough to endure more of his continual insults about my personality.<br /><br />
I started screwing the guy who lived one floor below me in my apartment building. He was 35 and 6'4" and had a body like stretched taffy--long and thin. We met on the subway, had a date in which we both realized that we just wanted to use each other for sex, and then proceeded to gloriously screw each other's brains out for several weeks. The sex wasn't awesome, but it was good and frequent. We're still Facebook friends, but we never spoke again after we moved.<br /><br />


I far prefer the kind of casual encounter where you know what/who you're getting into beforehand. But if you must pursue the internet route, just meet in public so you can bail if needed. You have a very easy, "I actually don't feel comfortable doing this" excuse.
