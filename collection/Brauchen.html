	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>I made a date once with a Canadian acrobat (... don't you judge me), but I was really tired, didn't feel sexy that evening and ended up cancelling. He added me on facebook and turned out to not be my type anyway.<br /><br />
I also posted a platonic thing once when I moved to a new city. Got a number of relatively sane responses, and ended up having a beer with a Spanish guy in the park. We had a nice chat, but there wasn't any friendship vibe, so we left it at that. One of the other responses I got was a fortysomething guy who kept calling me "interesting" -- I never met up with him, and thankfully he actually backed off on gmail chat when I told him I didn't want any more contact.
