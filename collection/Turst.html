	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>I've had two, both good. The first was with an older woman who responded to my post and was actually quite forward. We exchanged pictures and she invited me to come over after a couple days of correspondence. When I arrived we had to go up a few stairs to get to her living room and I could see that she wasn't wearing any underwear. From that point it was easy. I ended up going back about 5 or 6 times before I had to go back to school.<br /><br />
The second was a younger married woman. She was all too willing to send me naked pictures which made me a little worried. I lived in an extended stay type hotel at the time for an internship, so I wasn't too scared to have someone come over. She canceled the first scheduled time, but was on time the second. She said that she'd never done the craigslist thing before, but I could tell she was lying about 2 minutes into her arrival. We started having sex at about minute 4. It seemed like she did it all the time.<br /><br />
I'd say be careful, but it definitely can work out.
