	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>I only did it once and it didn't turn out so well.<br /><br />
I had answered an ad by a woman who said she was just looking for something casual. It seemed too good to be true, but she responded to me and we chatted via email and instant messenger for a week or so. We then exchanged phone numbers and talked on the phone. She seemed cool and genuine. We agreed to meet for coffee and see where it went.
We had coffee and things were going fine. After the coffee we walked around a little and then ended up at her car where we made out a little bit. She lived nearby so we agreed that I would follow her in my car to her place.<br /><br />
At her place we were sitting on the couch and kissed a little more then she sprung the truth on me. She went into the kitchen and came out with a guy. She introduced him as her husband and said she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. The husband assured me he would not get involved, he would sit on the other side of the room and watch. I declined and headed for the door envisioning myself being chopped to pieces by these two. They then suggested that they have sex and I watch and jerk off. When I was ready to explode I would shoot all over the wife's face. I again declined and left.<br /><br />
The next day she called me and apologized. I told her in the future she might want to lead with what she is really looking for so as not to waste her or other people's time.
