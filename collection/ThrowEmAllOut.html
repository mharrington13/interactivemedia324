	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>I have met a few girls in Craigslist. And before I say this, everything I'm about to say is 100% true. I don't like typing on my phone so these will be brief
First girl was the first and only black girl I ever slept with. (I'm a white guy) She wasn't exactly the best looking girl, but she was sweet and funny and nice and I later found out that she was a lesbian until shortly before posting the ad on CL to try to get back into guys. So we met in public and hit it off and we went back to her place and boned. We hung out a few times after that but the most memorable was the time when she grabbed her moms adderall and we went berserk. We were eating it and crushing it up and snorting it and fucking like crazy and playing left 4 dead all night long. At one point I thought it would be fun to snort a line off her ass and she thought it would be hilarious so I did and we laughed and laughed. It was a very fun night. I the end, she started to develop feelings that I didn't reciprocate so we broke it off.<br /><br />
I guess that wasn't so brief. If y'all are interested I have 3 more stories that are pretty wild to share if you want to hear them.
