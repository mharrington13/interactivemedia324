	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>I've learned to ask for a full body pic, not just a face pic. (Nothing wrong with bigger people, I've had sex with many people who weren't skinny and that's perfectly fine...but some people carry their weight better than others. Some people look really good with some weight on them and others....not so much. Random sex is all about attraction so if I'm not attracted, I really don't want to go through with it...although I have before)<br /><br />

One guy came over, but after I started blowing him he got scared and left. He was "straight" and I think he got a little scared about having a gay experience. <br /><br />

Another guy, I met up with him and when I got to his house he looked NOTHING like his picture...I said I had to go and just got out of there.
