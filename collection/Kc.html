	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>Background: I was an 18 year old female, first year university student.<br /><br />
One night I found myself perusing the casual encounters ads. Came across one ad that sparked my interest - he was 19, went to the same school as me and made it a point to mention that he was a virgin. I was fine with that and while I didn't want to take his virginity, I wasn't opposed to a bit of fooling around, which is all his ad was asking for.
We exchanged 2 or 3 emails, spoke on the phone and made arrangements to hang out the next day. The very first warning sign was when I suggested that we go for coffee and he replied with "Well I don't actually have any money, I was thinking we could just watch a movie in your dorm." Despite how strange this sounded (who doesn't have $1.50 for a coffee), I agreed.<br /><br />
He shows up at my apartment and is cute in an odd way. We go into my dorm (I had a single room) and as I turn my back to put the movie in my DVD player, he jumps onto my bed with his shoes on and tells me that he didn't brush his teeth and he is a self-proclaimed Mama's boy. I smiled awkwardly and asked him nicely to remove his shoes and he basically took them off and threw them at me. I'm in major WTF mode now, but chalking it up to nervousness and social awkwardness.<br /><br />
So we get on to my bed and start watching the movie and he is suddenly all about the cuddle. His arm is around me and he keeps squeezing me tight against him and nuzzling my neck. I'm feeling uncomfortable, but I recognize that I agreed to a casual encounter and so I let this continue. I look down and he is sporting full wood through his jeans. Granted, I was flattered, but his nuzzling and squeezing was just so off-putting I could not bring myself to do anything. A few minutes later, I decide that perhaps making out with this guy would be less traumatizing than his now rhythmic nuzzle 'n squeeze.<br /><br />
I turn my face towards him and go in for a kiss and I swear to God, he ate my entire face. He missed my fucking mouth and his teeth dug into my cheek. I was basically playing whack-a-mole as he grabbed at my tits violently and he started dry humping me, darting his tongue into my mouth. I kept trying to push him off of me to say it wasn't comfortable for me and that I wasn't enjoying myself, but he kept going. I'm pretty much praying for the sweet release of death at this point, when all of a sudden he stops (after some particularly vigorous humping), looks at me and says "I just came. You were fantastic." Sure enough, I looked down and there was some wetness seeping through his jeans. I thought I was being Punk'd. I told him he needed to leave and pretty much pushed him out of my apartment before hopping in the shower and scrubbing like a rape victim.<br /><br />
I still haven't recovered.
