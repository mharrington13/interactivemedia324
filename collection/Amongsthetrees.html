	<p> <font color="#ff7eae">"</font>It can definitely end well, though I only have one experience with it under my belt. Also, I am speaking from a female perspective.<br /><br />
	I replied to an ad from casual encounters that was looking for someone to chill out and smoke some weed, and he just happened to live in my neighbourhood. Awesome. We exchanged some emails and photos then decided to meet up. <br /><br />
	We took a stroll to the beach, smoked some doobies and then wandered back to his place. Ate some strawberries with chocolate fondue (I like to make awesome stoner snacks), smoked another doobie, had some sex, and then repeated the last two. Had a bit of a nap and then I wandered home. <br /><br />
	All in all a good experience and I would definitely do it again.
